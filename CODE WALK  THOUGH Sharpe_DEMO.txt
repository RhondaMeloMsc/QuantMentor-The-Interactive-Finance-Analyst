CODE WALKTHOUGH Sharpe_DEMO

1) Header & docstring

#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Sharpe Ratio Demo (Educational)

Usage:
    python scripts/sharpe_demo.py examples/sample_returns.csv

The script calculates an approximate Sharpe ratio using daily returns.
It prints plain-English explanations and the numeric result.
"""
	•	Shebang (#!/usr/bin/env python3): Lets Unix-like systems run the file directly (e.g., ./sharpe_demo.py) by using the system’s Python 3 interpreter.
	•	Docstring: Human-facing description and quick usage note. It tells you the script expects a CSV path and that it will compute a Sharpe ratio from daily returns.
Finance meaning: We’re about to compute the Sharpe ratio, which is a signal-to-noise metric: average excess return (signal) divided by volatility (noise). Higher is better, but context matters (sample length, market regime, etc.).

2) Imports

import sys
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
	•	sys: For reading command-line arguments (the CSV path).
	•	pandas: For data loading/manipulation; we’ll parse dates and reference columns by name.
	•	numpy: For math (np.sqrt, np.nan).

3) Entry point function

def main(path):
    df = pd.read_csv(path, parse_dates=["date"])
	•	main(path): The script’s core logic; path is the CSV file location.
	•	pd.read_csv(..., parse_dates=["date"]): Loads the CSV into a DataFrame, parsing the date column into datetime objects so the data is time-aware.
Finance meaning: We’re assuming daily observations. The clock matters because Sharpe depends on the frequency of returns and we later annualize using a daily → annual scaling.

4) Input validation

    if not {"strategy_return", "risk_free_daily"}.issubset(df.columns):
        raise ValueError("CSV must include 'strategy_return' and 'risk_free_daily'.")
	•	Checks that the CSV has both required columns.
Finance meaning:
	•	strategy_return: Your portfolio/strategy’s daily simple return (e.g., 0.002 = +0.2%).
	•	risk_free_daily: The daily risk-free rate (e.g., Treasury bill equivalent, converted to a daily rate). Sharpe is about excess return over risk-free, not raw return. If you don’t subtract a baseline, you can overstate risk-adjusted performance.

5) Excess return construction

    # Excess daily returns
    excess = df["strategy_return"] - df["risk_free_daily"]
	•	Vectorized subtraction: one daily series minus another.
Finance meaning: This yields the daily compensation for risk—what you earned beyond a theoretically safe alternative. If risk_free_daily is tiny (common), excess ≈ strategy return; still, using it is correct and future-proof.

6) Mean & volatility estimates

    mean_excess = excess.mean()
    std_excess = excess.std(ddof=1)  # sample std
    sharpe_daily = mean_excess / std_excess if std_excess != 0 else np.nan
	•	excess.mean(): Average daily excess return (your “signal”).
	•	excess.std(ddof=1): Sample standard deviation (unbiased estimator with ddof=1), your “noise.”
	•	sharpe_daily: The daily Sharpe = signal/noise, unless std_excess is 0 (no variation), where we safely return NaN.
Finance meaning:
	•	Mean excess answers: On average, how much do I beat the risk-free rate per day?
	•	Std (volatility) answers: How bumpy is that path?
	•	Sharpe answers: How much reward per unit of risk am I getting? Rough rules of thumb (very context-dependent):
	◦	0–1: modest
	◦	1–2: decent/solid
	◦	2: strong (suspiciously strong if sustained without drawdowns) 
Why ddof=1? We estimate volatility from a finite sample; using the sample std avoids underestimating variability.

7) Annualization

    # Annualization (approx using 252 trading days)
    sharpe_annual = sharpe_daily * np.sqrt(252) if not np.isnan(sharpe_daily) else np.nan
	•	Converts daily Sharpe to annual Sharpe by multiplying by sqrt(252) (approx trading days/year).
Finance meaning: If returns are independently distributed across days (a big if), Sharpe scales with the square root of time. Correlation, volatility clustering, and regime shifts can break this neat scaling—so treat it as an approximation, not gospel.

8) Output: education + numbers

    print("Sharpe Ratio Demo (Educational)")
    print("-" * 32)
    print("Plain-English interpretation:")
    print("• We compared your strategy's daily return to a daily risk-free rate to get 'excess return'.")
    print("• We measured the average excess return and how much it wiggles day to day (its standard deviation).")
    print("• Sharpe ≈ average excess return ÷ its wiggliness (volatility).")
    print("• Higher is better; 0–1 is modest, 1–2 is solid, >2 is strong (context-dependent).")
    print()
    print(f"Mean excess (daily): {mean_excess:.6f}")
    print(f"Std excess  (daily): {std_excess:.6f}")
    print(f"Sharpe (daily):      {sharpe_daily:.3f}")
    print(f"Sharpe (annualized): {sharpe_annual:.3f}")
	•	Prints a short, friendly explanation first (so non-quants can follow), then the key statistics.
	•	Formatting (:.6f, :.3f) keeps numbers readable and comparable.
Finance meaning: You get both the intuition and the figures. That’s the ethos: explain the why alongside the what.

9) CLI guard and invocation

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python scripts/sharpe_demo.py examples/sample_returns.csv")
        sys.exit(1)
    main(sys.argv[1])
	•	Standard Python pattern: only run main(...) when the file is executed directly.
	•	Reads the CSV path from the first command-line argument; prints help and exits if missing.
Workflow meaning: This keeps the script simple to call from a terminal or to import into a notebook as a helper (by skipping the CLI section).

What this really measures (and what to watch)
	1	It’s a sample statistic. The Sharpe here is an estimate based on your sample window. Short windows → noisy estimates.
	2	Assumptions matter. Annualization assumes i.i.d. returns. Serial correlation, volatility clustering, or fat tails will make the annualized Sharpe optimistic relative to realized experience.
	3	Excess return over a realistic risk-free. If risk_free_daily is a rough proxy (e.g., constant), that’s usually fine for demos; production workflows should build a proper daily series from an accepted benchmark.
	4	Drawdown & asymmetry ignored. Sharpe treats upside and downside volatility equally. A more nuanced view might also include Sortino (downside risk), max drawdown, skewness, etc.
	5	Estimation hygiene. Make sure your returns are clean, aligned (no look-ahead), and include transaction costs if comparing to live trading. Otherwise, Sharpe will be overstated.

If you want to extend this next
	•	Add a --rf flag to fetch or specify a risk-free series more precisely.
	•	Winsorize or robustify the volatility estimate (e.g., robust std or EWMA volatility).
	•	New outputs:
	◦	number of observations,
	◦	t-stat of mean excess (rough signal strength check),
	◦	confidence intervals via bootstrap.
	•	Plot diagnostics: distribution of daily excess returns, rolling Sharpe, drawdown curve.
