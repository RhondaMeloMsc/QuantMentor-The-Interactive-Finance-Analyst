THE PURPOSE OF THE ohlc_synth.csv



ohlc_synth.csv is a tiny, synthetic dataset I generated so you can run and sanity-check the backtest scripts immediately, without hunting for real market data.
What it’s for
	•	Quick smoke tests: Verify the scripts run end-to-end (file loading, signal generation, execution alignment, costs, metrics).
	•	Covers both execution modes: It has open and close columns, so you can test --exec open and --exec close.
	•	Try return conventions: Safe place to compare --use-log-returns vs simple returns.
	•	Deterministic & shareable: No licenses or API keys; the series is reproducible, so results are stable across machines.
	•	CI / examples: Handy fixture for automated checks and for docs/readme examples.
What’s inside
	•	Columns: date, open, close (business-day frequency).
	•	The price path is a mild random walk with small “overnight” gaps between close and next day open.
How to use it

# Close-to-close, simple returns
python scripts/backtest_scaffold_plus.py /mnt/data/ohlc_synth.csv --fee-bps 1.5 --window 20

# Open-to-open, log returns
python scripts/backtest_scaffold_plus.py /mnt/data/ohlc_synth.csv --exec open --use-log-returns --fee-bps 2 --window 40


What it is NOT
	•	Not real market data. Don’t infer genuine strategy performance from it.
	•	Not for research conclusions. It’s purely a functional test bed to validate logic (no look-ahead, cost application, rolling metrics, etc.).
