THE PURPOSE OF the sample_returns.csv

🎯 Purpose of sample_returns.csv
The file sample_returns.csv is a tiny example dataset created to let you instantly test and demonstrate your Sharpe Ratio scripts — specifically sharpe_demo.py and sharpe_demo_plus.py — without needing any real market data.
It exists to make the Sharpe ratio calculations reproducible, testable, and explainable from the very first run.

🧩 Why it was included
When you’re writing quant utilities (like Sharpe or backtesting scaffolds), you need a self-contained test input. This CSV does exactly that — it ensures anyone cloning your repo or running your educational scripts can do so out of the box.
No data APIs. No credentials. No dependencies.
That’s why the file is called sample_returns.csv — it’s a small, synthetic dataset with the right structure to validate your Sharpe logic end-to-end.

🧠 What’s inside
Column
Meaning
date
Daily business dates (e.g., “2024-01-02”, “2024-01-03”…).
strategy_return
Simulated daily strategy returns — small random numbers that approximate real trading results.
risk_free_daily
Simulated daily risk-free rate — usually around 0.00005 (≈1.25% annualized).
So each row represents a single trading day, with your strategy’s return and the risk-free rate for that day.

⚙️ How it’s used
When you run:

python scripts/sharpe_demo_plus.py examples/sample_returns.csv --window 60 --out rolling_sharpe.png
the script:
	1	Reads strategy_return and risk_free_daily.
	2	Computes excess returns = strategy_return - risk_free_daily.
	3	Calculates mean, standard deviation, and the Sharpe ratio (daily and annualized).
	4	Plots the rolling Sharpe curve and saves it to rolling_sharpe.png.
This CSV lets you test:
	•	Sharpe computation logic,
	•	Rolling window mechanics (--window flag),
	•	Chart output (--out flag),
	•	And educational print statements.

🧮 Finance interpretation
The data is synthetic but realistic — enough to simulate how a quant analyst would:
	•	Calculate risk-adjusted returns,
	•	Annualize the Sharpe ratio using √252, and
	•	Interpret stability over time.
It gives you a safe sandbox to learn and explain why Sharpe ratios matter and how to interpret them.

🧾 In the bigger picture
Here’s how it fits your project’s hierarchy:
File
Purpose
sample_returns.csv
Test input for Sharpe ratio demos.
ohlc_synth.csv
Test input for backtesting with open/close prices.
ohlc_with_rf.csv
Test input for excess returns (with risk-free series).
rolling_sharpe.png
Output visualization of rolling Sharpe over time.
Together, they form a minimal quant lab environment that mirrors real professional analytics — all safely synthetic and self-contained.

✅ In one sentence:
sample_returns.csv is your educational testbed — a small synthetic return dataset used to verify, demonstrate, and visually explain how Sharpe ratios and rolling performance metrics are calculated and interpreted.
