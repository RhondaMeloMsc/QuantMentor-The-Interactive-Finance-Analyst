THE PURPOSE OF THE ohlc_with_rf.csv 



so here’s what the ohlc_with_rf.csv 

🎯 Purpose
It’s a synthetic test dataset that extends the simpler ohlc_synth.csv by adding a risk-free return column. This lets you test the --riskfree-col feature in your enhanced Backtest Scaffold Plus script.
In short, it exists to validate that your script can:
	1	Subtract a daily risk-free rate when computing excess returns.
	2	Recalculate Sharpe and Sortino ratios correctly on that excess (not raw) return stream.
	3	Print or export those results in the mini risk summary and tearsheet CSV.


📊 What it contains
Column
Meaning
date
Daily business dates.
open
Synthetic open price series.
close
Synthetic close price series.
riskfree (or rf)
Small positive daily rate, e.g. ~0.00005 (≈1.25% annualized).
So it mimics an environment where you have a T-bill proxy or daily funding rate.


⚙️ Example usage

# run strategy with risk-free adjustment
python scripts/backtest_scaffold_plus.py ohlc_with_rf.csv \
    --riskfree-col riskfree --fee-bps 1 --window 30
The script will then:
	•	load the CSV,
	•	calculate daily returns,
	•	subtract the riskfree column to get excess returns,
	•	compute Sharpe, Sortino, max DD, etc., using that excess series.


🧠 Why this is useful
	•	Educational realism: In real quant backtests, Sharpe ratios must use excess returns.
	•	Regression-ready: You can later extend this file to include a benchmark series (e.g. SPY_ret) for beta/alpha regressions.
	•	Sanity check: Verifies your CLI flag parsing and risk-free logic before integrating actual market data (like FRED T-bill rates).
