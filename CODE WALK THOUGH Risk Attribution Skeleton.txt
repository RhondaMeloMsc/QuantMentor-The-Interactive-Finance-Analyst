CODE WALK THOUGH Risk Attribution Skeleton


let’s unpack the Risk Attribution Skeleton line by line, and translate every line into “what it really means” in finance terms.

The script

#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Risk Attribution Skeleton (Educational)

Provide a CSV with columns: date, ticker, return
The script estimates simple variance contributions by ticker.
"""

	•	Shebang: lets you run the file directly on Unix-like systems (./risk_attribution.py).
	•	Docstring: this is a teaching scaffold. Input must be a tidy table with one row per (date, ticker) and a column named return (daily simple return is typical).
Finance meaning: we’re going to look at each ticker’s return variability over time and rank them. It’s a baby step toward risk attribution.


import sys, pandas as pd

	•	Imports sys (for CLI args) and pandas (for data wrangling).


def main(path):
    df = pd.read_csv(path, parse_dates=["date"])

	•	Defines the entry function and loads the CSV.
	•	parse_dates=["date"] turns the date column into a proper datetime; that’s important if you later want time windows (e.g., last 60 trading days).
Finance meaning: our dataset is a panel: many dates × many tickers.


    required = {"date", "ticker", "return"}
    if not required.issubset(df.columns):
        raise ValueError(f"CSV must include {required}")

	•	Schema check. You must have exactly these columns. If not, fail fast.
Finance meaning: we expect returns already computed. (If you had prices instead, you’d need to compute returns first.)


    by_ticker = df.groupby("ticker")["return"].var().sort_values(ascending=False)

This single line does the core work:
	1	df.groupby("ticker") — form a group for each ticker.
	2	["return"].var() — within each ticker, compute the sample variance of the return series (pandas uses ddof=1 by default). Variance is the average squared deviation from the mean; it measures volatility (in squared-return units).
	3	.sort_values(ascending=False) — rank tickers from highest variance (most volatile) to lowest.
Finance meaning:
	•	This is a per-ticker volatility ranking. It tells you which names are the noisiest over your sample.
	•	The docstring says “estimates simple variance contributions by ticker.” That wording is intentionally loose: true portfolio risk contribution depends on portfolio weights and covariances. This line computes standalone variance by ticker, not each name’s contribution to a weighted portfolio’s variance.
	•	Still, it’s useful: if your portfolio is roughly equal-weighted and correlations are similar, high-variance names tend to dominate your volatility. But beware: a low-variance name highly correlated with your portfolio could still contribute meaningfully to total risk.


    print("Variance by ticker (higher = more contribution to total volatility):")
    print(by_ticker.to_string())


	•	Pretty-prints the series.
Finance meaning:
	•	Read as a league table of raw volatility by ticker.
	•	Interpreting it literally as “contribution to total volatility” is an approximation. To compute actual % contribution to portfolio variance, you need weights and the covariance matrix (details below).


if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python scripts/risk_attribution.py path/to/returns_by_ticker.csv")
        sys.exit(1)
    main(sys.argv[1])


	•	Command-line glue. Requires a file path; otherwise prints usage.
	•	Calls main(path).
	•	

What this really measures (and what it doesn’t)
✅ What it gives you (correctly)
	•	A ranking of tickers by their own return variance over the sample window.
	•	A fast way to spot which names are the most volatile on a standalone basis.
❗ What it doesn’t capture (yet)
	•	Portfolio weights. In a real portfolio, a tiny position in a wild name may contribute less risk than a big position in a calm name.
	•	Cross-asset covariance. Portfolio volatility isn’t the sum of standalone variances;   
	•	Frequency scaling. Variance depends on the return frequency (daily vs weekly). The script doesn’t annualize; results are on the input frequency scale.
	•	Robustness. Outliers or data quality issues can dominate variance. Sometimes you’ll want winsorization or robust estimators.

If you wanted true “risk contribution” (% of portfolio variance)
For a portfolio with weights vector
	•	Portfolio variance: 
	•	Marginal contribution to risk (per asset i):
	•	Component (or absolute) contribution to risk: 
	•	Percent contribution to risk: 
This is the standard decomposition used on pro desks. It answers, “What fraction of my total volatility comes from each position, considering correlations?”

Practical caveats you’d care about on a desk
	•	Non-synchronous data / missing dates: ensure each ticker’s series lines up; fill/align carefully.
	•	Survivorship bias: if your dataset only includes winners, variance estimates will be biased.
	•	Regime dependence: compute over rolling windows (e.g., 60D/120D) to see if a name’s risk spikes in certain regimes.
	•	Annualization: if you want annualized variance/vol, multiply by ~252 (for variance) or √252 (for vol).
	•	Return definition: decide if you want simple or log returns; be consistent.

Tiny upgrade (optional) to show both variance and volatility (annualized)
If your input is daily returns:

by_ticker_var = df.groupby("ticker")["return"].var(ddof=1)
by_ticker_vol_ann = (by_ticker_var ** 0.5) * (252 ** 0.5)


Now you can print both variance and annualized volatility per ticker—vol is often more intuitive.

Summary (how to read the current output)
	•	The script is intentionally minimal: it answers “which tickers are the most volatile (standalone)?”
	•	Use it to triage risk hotspots quickly.
	•	For real risk attribution, bring in weights and compute covariance-aware contributions as above. That’s the next step I can add when you’re ready.
